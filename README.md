JSFX

- [ ] Ping-pong delay
- [ ] Detect chords
- [ ] Blow air into mic game
- [ ] Flappy bird game (Flappy Square)
- [ ] Airwindows: Convert to JSFX: Spiral or Mojo
- Focus, an all-in-one distortion suite that includes, among others, the Spiral and Mojo algorithms (you may also try Distortion, which is pretty similar except without the frequency selection)
- PurestGain, as JSFX's ability to type exact values would work wonders on this
- Preponderant, a plugin that does the opposite of popular resonance-removing plugins like Soothe, TEOTE and the freeware Vastaus (we need to implement an "Inverse" function in the Dry/Wet just like in other Airwindows plugins, so it does actually function as a Soothe-like plugin)
- DeBess, as it is an excellent de-esser but its structure may not be easy to understand for beginners (same with Pressure4)
- Infinity2 (so you can kill the feedback with a button instead of dragging the Feedback fader to the left)
- CStrip may be good for JSFX, and I'd like to try its TimeLag function with exact values

- [ ] Control dry/wet depending on gain (think about how reverb works in a hall: louder means more reverb)
- [ ] Fernando Imperator (https://twitter.com/imperat) Feature idea: If you ever develop a version that instead of rendering the multicam video, just creates an XML to import to Adobe Premiere or DaVinci, it'd be awesome.

- [ ] Other topics to cover:
    - [ ] Even when youâ€™re clipping in the middle of a FX chain, or in a channel, thereâ€™s a chance that you wonâ€™t clip in the end, of somewhere in the pipeline thereâ€™s another thing that brings the gain down
        - [ ] That works because internally REAPER (and many other DAWs) use 64 bits per sample, as opposed to the 16/24/32 that youâ€™d find in other places
        - [ ] But itâ€™s generally a bad idea to rely on this, because some effects donâ€™t work as well when the input is clipping
        - [ ] When writing JSFX, this means that sometimes your samples wonâ€™t be in the â€“1 - 1 range

 The first idea is a script that would open a dialog box in REAPER. In the dialogue box, you can enter a shortcut or simply paste a command ID, and in the first case, it would look for the command ID with that shortcut assigned to it, and in the second case it would just use the ID to generate a smart marker at edit cursor position. Currently there is an outboarder script that allows making a custom name and color marker, but all the modifications needs to be done by duplicating the script and editing values in the IDE, so I thought It'd be cool if there was a way of to have a dialog box basically kinda fill in those strings. That way it could be a hotkey or toolbar icon and it would quickly generate a bunch of action markers even by hotkey inputs.

  It would be nice if there was a script in REAPER that would generate an ADR script from a list of item names. The studio I used to work in had a similar setup for Pro Tools, where you would make clip regions, and then export a text file from Pro Tools. It would have the start timecode and the name of the clip region, which you would then paste into an excel sheet, and it would generate a script based on that. I'll have to dig it up but basically let me know if any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in and we can keep communicating from there!


   Basically it would be an action to write the volume/pan/pitch envelope of a track onto the items that are on the track. It's really useful in films cuz the sound editor usually doesn't do automation and the mixer does, so with this script, the sound designer can mix their own reaper project, and then in the end just write all of the automation to the items, and they can then just clear all the track envelopes and the project is ready to mix. 

 It'll be useful for other people too cuz track envelopes have a lot more features overall, like latch preview (items have them but they're a pain and again, way fewer actions to toggle them etc.) and also track envelopes are more straightforward to assign to midi controllers than items (speaking of which, action to assign midi cc to "selected items volume" is useful too and I think that one doesn't exist either) but then writing all that to the item frees up the envelope lanes once again, and also items can then be freely position across tracks.

 A delay plugin in which you can route anything into the feedback chain by using a non-causal loop in a sandwich of effects.

- Alternatives:
  - [The original REAPER JSFX extension on which this is based](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=173289). It doesnâ€™t have as many features (for example, track priorities), and is more prone to bugs because it relies on inter-plugin communication. But itâ€™s easier to setup for simple cases and it supports projects with massive numbers of tracks, while this modification is limited by the 64 channels per track that REAPER offers.
  - [TBProAudioâ€™s AMM Automatic Microphone Mixer](https://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/amm.html). Itâ€™s limited to 16 stereo tracks and requires a setup with transmitters and receiver plugin instances, which limits the possibility of having independent groups of automixed tracks.
